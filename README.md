### Kain and Andrew's Assignment


Front-end based on TheBlindHawk/Roulette - I couln't have put together the Javascript.
Work to do:
  use the web3 framework to call contracts on the smart chain
  we have an asynchronous roll function that just needs some help. From what I understand we just need to load in the CasinoInterface ABI, and then web3 will be able to

    1) call the contract
    2) return JSON containing that value
