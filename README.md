### Kain and Andrew's Assignment


Front-end based on TheBlindHawk/Roulette - I couln't have put together the Javascript.

Work to do:

  use the web3 framework to call contracts on the smart chain
  we have an asynchronous roll function that just needs some help. From what I understand we just need to load in the CasinoInterface ABI, and then web3 will be able to

    1) call the contract
    2) return JSON containing that value

TODO
finish Cho Han logic - can only roll when you have selected an odd or even bet

parametrise idex.html - Im sure I can move the javascript into a different folder

Tidy up in general - I am not using much of the initial example I copied from - I'm sure I dont need its source either and can just use npm install.

Figure out why the linebreaks in this document arent getting sent to github
